# Working with Javascript libraries

When developing with any programming language, the use of libraries is very essential. So this section introduces you to a first (simple) Javascript library.

jQuery is a small library and was one of the first to bring interaction to web pages. Though modern applications use much more capable and complex frameworks, it is still very good to learn some basic JavaScript concepts.

Main file to start implementing tasks is [index.html](index.html). You will need a HTTP server to host this file and there is plenty of choice. An easy setup is, to use npm to run a simple server. It can be installed like so `npm install -g http-server`. After installation you can `http-server . -c-1` in folder where index.html is located. Note -c param prevents browser from caching.
